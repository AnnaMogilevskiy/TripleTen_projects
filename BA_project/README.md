# Project - Business Analytics. Yandex.Afisha
##  Project description
###  Project's objective
The goal of the project was to optimize marketing expenses of Yandex.Afisha, to advise marketing experts how much money to invest and where, what sources/platforms to use.
###  Overview of the data

**I had three csv files with:**

- Server logs with data on Yandex.Afisha visits from June 2017 through May 2018;
- Dump file with all orders for the period;
- Marketing expenses statistics.
  
**The questions I answered:**

- How people use the product;
- When they start to buy;
- How much money each customer brings;
- When they pay off

###  Expected outcomes or results

To answer the questions and make reports about:

**Usage of the products:**

- How many people use it every day, week, and month?
- How many sessions are there per day?
- What is the length of each session?
- What's the user retention rate?

**Sales:**

- When do people start buying?
- How many orders do they make during a given period of time?
- What is the average purchase size?
- How much money do they bring?

**Marketing:**

- How much money was spent? Overall, per source and over time.
- How much did customer acquisition from each of the sources cost?
- How worthwhile were the investments?


### The Process

First of all I made a full data overview, including checking the files sizes and optimization of big file by changing datatypes.
After I made Data preprocessing: changed column names, converted columns with dates to datetime format, checked for duplicate and missing values. When the data was clean I made full analysis using appropriate metrics, cohort analysis, visualizations, pivot tables.

### Results

On each step of my analysis I left comments about my findings and at the end of my project I resumed everything and wrote recommendations.
