# Project - AtliQ Hardware Financial Analysis


This is the final project I worked on in the TripleTen Data Science program. This project was the most independent project I've worked on and I loved it.

### AtliQ Hardware sales

The goal of the project was to conduct Financial Analysis of AtliQ Hardware sales, do the research, test the hypothesis, and make conclusions about our findings.

#### The Data

AtliQ Hardware has provided us with a backup of their database in the SQLite format. 

**The data was spread across six tables:**
- customers;
- products;
- discounts;
- manufacturing cost of each product;
- gross price of each product;
- monthly sales.


#### The Process

First of all I explored and checked all tables for missing and duplicate values, I took all necessary columns from different tables using SQL query and made one DataFrame which gave me an opportunity to make additional calculations for my research. I made financial analyses using appropriate metrics, visualizations, pivot tables and tested hypotheses. 

#### Results

Taking the time to explain my results at each step was a key element in this process. I wrote an introduction and conclusions about the  dynamics in a company's development and profit growth and added the __[Tableau Presentation](https://public.tableau.com/views/Dashboardsfinalproject/Presentation?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)__.
